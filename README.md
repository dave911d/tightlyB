# dashy
Dashboard program for my PC's.Planned to support windows and linux(probs just x86_x64)

To run simply:
1.cd to the directory
2.run npm install (possibly as sudo or administrator if problems arise)
3.launch your redis server
4.define the port and IP of said redis server in your redisconfig/configRethinkDb.js file.
5.run node dashboard.js
